## How to contribute to chess-ai-game?

If you wish to fix a bug or add a feature, just be sure to write unit tests for it and that the project passes all the pytest and pylint checks before opening a pull request.

## What if I want to add an AI to the project?
Aside from the stupid test one, proper AIs don't belong to this repo, so please create a new repository, let me know and I'll be happy to link it here!
